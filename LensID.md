# 🌀 Fast Machine Learning for Detecting Lensed Gravitational Waves

*Based on Goyal et al. (arXiv:2106.12466 / Phys. Rev. D 104, 124057)*

## 🚀 Introduction: Why Lensed Gravitational Waves Matter

Strong gravitational lensing by galaxies or clusters can produce **multiple copies** of the same gravitational-wave (GW) event—separated in time and magnified differently. Detecting these is crucial for testing general relativity, probing dark matter, and studying cosmology ([arXiv][2]).

## 🧮 The Growing Challenge

Next-generation GW detectors may observe up to **1 million binary black hole events per year**, prompting **10¹⁰ – 10¹² pair comparisons**. Traditional Bayesian lensing validation for every pair takes hours each—making brute-force unfeasible ([arXiv][2]).

## 🤖 A Two-Stage Machine Learning Pipeline

### **Stage 1: Fast Data Representations**

* **Q‑transform maps** (time–frequency spectrograms) capture signal shape.
* **Bayestar skymaps** estimate sky localization.
  Both are generated in seconds—not hours like Bayesian posteriors ([arXiv][2]).

### **Stage 2: Machine Learning Classifier**

Pairs of Q-transform and skymap data are fed into:

* A CNN (DenseNet) per detector producing features
* An XGBoost classifier combines these features
* A second XGBoost classifier on skymap overlap
  This network rapidly discriminates lensed vs. unlensed pairs, dramatically reducing candidates for Bayesian follow-up ([arXiv][2], [ar5iv][3]).

## 📊 Visual Example: Q‑Transform Maps of Paired Events

This figure shows aligned Q-transform inputs for two candidate signal pairs:

* **Top row**: A truly lensed pair—presenting similar shapes.
* **Bottom row**: An unlensed pair—visually distinct.

These serve as input to the ML classifier engine, which learns shape similarity and amplitude differences as discriminants.

---

## ✅ Key Findings

* The ML approach **matches Bayesian classification accuracy** on simulated non-spinning binary black hole signals in Gaussian noise.
* It **filters out the majority of unlensed pairs**, making full Bayesian comparison possible only for promising candidates ([arXiv][1], [arXiv][2]).

---

## 🧭 Why It Matters

* This method enables **scalable lensing detection** in massive datasets where Bayesian inference alone is impractical.
* Crucial for upcoming detector runs (e.g. 3G networks), where event rates will explode and efficient screening is essential.

| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Problem           | Massive number of pair comparisons is computationally expensive |
| ML-based approach | Uses Q-transforms and skymaps to preselect candidate pairs      |
| Accuracy          | Comparable to optimal Bayesian inference                        |
| Benefit           | Orders‑of‑magnitude speed-up before full Bayesian follow-up     |
