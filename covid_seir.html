  <h1>What SEIR Taught Us About Pandemic Policy</h1>
  <p><em>JulyÂ 26,Â 2025 â€¢ Epidemiology â€¢ Data Science</em></p>

  <p>My work on COVIDâ€‘19 modeling focused on extending the SEIR framework to account for <strong>asymptomatic transmission</strong>. We included an extra compartment for asymptomatic carriers and modeled testing and quarantine strategies.</p>

  <h2>ðŸ§ª Model Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Compartmental divisions: Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Asymptomatic (I<sub>A</sub>), Symptomatic (I<sub>S</sub>), Recovered (R)</li>
    <li>Transmission from both symptomatic and asymptomatic groups</li>
    <li>Environmental or fomite transmission (pathogen compartment)</li>
    <li>Analytical solutions and simulations to optimize interventions</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>ðŸ“ˆ Simulation Curves</h2>

  <p><em>Figure: Modelled infection trajectories under different testing and isolation policies.</em></p>

  <p>Early identification of asymptomatic cases significantly flattens peak infections and reduces the outbreak size.</p>
